## ezSIFT: An easy-to-use stanalone SIFT library.
* Original URL: https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezsift
* github URL: https://github.com/robertwgh/ezSIFT

The SIFT (scale-invariant feature transform) algorithm is considered to be one of the most robust local feature detector and description methods. Most of the open-source SIFT implementations rely on some 3rd-party libraries. Some of them even rely on a few different large libraries. These dependencies make the installation, compilation and usage not easy.

The ezSIFT library provides a standalone and lightweight SIFT implementation written in C/C++. The ezSIFT is self-contained, and does not require any other libraries. So it is easy to use and modify. Besides, the implementation of the ezSIFT is straightforward and easy to read. 

For this project, C/C++ source code, Visual Studio 2010„ÄÅ2012 project files, and Android NDK project files are provided.

### Documentation
Please read [ezSIFT Wiki page](https://github.com/robertwgh/ezSIFT/wiki) for details.

### Versions
* Created on 9/16/2013.
* Modified on 3/27/2015.
* Uploaded to github.com on 6/26/2018.

### Examples
I also provide two examples showing how to use this library:

* `examples/feature_extract.cpp`: detect keypoints and extract feature descriptor from a single image.
* `examples/image_match.cpp`: detect keypoints and extract features from two images and perform feature matching. 

### How to build
#### For Mac OS
Follow the following instructions:
```Bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
Then you can find the built binary under `build/bin` directory.

Or, you can use the following instruction to generate Xcode project:
```Bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -GXcode
```
Then, open `ezsift.xcodeproj` project to build.

#### For Visual Studio 2010/2012 (currently VS project is broken, I will fix them soon.)
1. Go to `build/vs2010` or `build/vs2012`, open `ezsift.sln`. 
2. Build solution. 
3. You will find executable files under `build/vs2010/bin` or `build/vs2012/bin`.

#### For Android NDK native mode
1. Please install Android NDK package, and add NDK root folder to your system environment PATH. 
2. Go to `build/android`.
3. run `./build.sh`
4. You will find the binaries under `build/android/bin/`.
5. Connect an Android device to your computer using ADB. Use `install_and_run.sh` to install the binaries and run it on the devices.
